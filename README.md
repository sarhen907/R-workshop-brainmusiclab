# r-workshop-brainmusiclab
R workshop for the Brain and Music Lab - basic introduction to using R for data analysis and visualization. 
Updated February 2020

Welcome to the Comprehensive R-Tutorial. This is a workshop/crash-course taught to the research assistants of the Brain and Music Lab by Sarah, Priscilla, and Alison. 
This is intended to be helpful for your research goals and beyond. However, please keep in mind that we are not experts. 
We have all learned R, stats, and programming fairly recently, too! We just want to share that knowledge with you. 

Please download everything in this repository for best results! 

WHAT THIS IS: An ever-expanding notebook of how to use R for various data-related activities. 
Because we are always learning (yay!), this notebook is never finished. 

WHAT THIS IS NOT: A statistics class!!! 
You will find this workshop the most useful if you have taken a prior basic stats class and/or done your own research. 
While we will do our best to explain basic concepts, stats is a very large field and we are not experts :)

ALSO NOTE: all of the data in this is FAKE DATA. 
While the participants, groups, and tasks may look like they are from our study, the data is completely randomized by a program in matlab. 
Additionaly, if you feel that any of the below explanations are incorrect, donâ€™t make sense, or need to be elaborated upon, PLEASE LET US KNOW!
